READ ME:
This is a ToDo List project built for Silverhorn's case study. The project was completed using react. It took longer than expected as I am still learning to code
with JS/React. 

Current features:
- Add/delete items to/from the list
- User is able to edit the list after the application is reopened
- Items can be marked as completed
- CSS styling

Time Spent: 5 hours

How to install:
- Pull from github - https://github.com/garethleong074/ToDoList.git
- Go to command prompt and go to the directory of the project (cd)
- Type 'npm start' to start the app
